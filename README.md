## 🚀 About Me
I believe work should feel like play. So, I code, explore, and build things that excite me.  
By day, I craft scalable web applications. When I’m not wrangling code, I’m exploring game development, trying out new tools, or prototyping ideas that might actually work someday. I enjoy making things that just work (or at least look cool).  

I love pushing boundaries in both code and creativity - constantly learning, constantly building, constantly curious.  

Fun fact: If a project excites me, I’ll likely spend hours debugging just to make it perfect… and still enjoy every second. 😄

## 🎯 What I Do
- **Web Development:** Crafting responsive, high-performance full-stack apps - currently working full-time on backend systems.
- **Side projects:** Working on a few projects that might not be revolutionary, but aim to be better than the competition. Finding a niche no one has taken is hard—so I focus on making what exists, better.
- **Tech Exploration:** Always diving into new languages, frameworks, and tools.  
- **Game Dev:** Prototyping mechanics and experimenting with game design.
